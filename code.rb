# Warmup
# Write a recursive method, range, that takes a start and an end and returns an array of all numbers in that range, exclusive. For example, range(1, 5) should return [1, 2, 3, 4]. If end < start, you can return an empty array.
# Write both a recursive and iterative version of sum of an array.

def range(start,finish)
  return [] if finish <= start

  [start] + range(start+1, finish)

end


# Exponentiation
# Write two versions of exponent that use two different recursions:

# # this is math, not Ruby methods.

# # recursion 1
# exp(b, 0) = 1
# exp(b, n) = b * exp(b, n - 1)

# # recursion 2
# exp(b, 0) = 1
# exp(b, 1) = b
# exp(b, n) = exp(b, n / 2) ** 2             [for even n]
# exp(b, n) = b * (exp(b, (n - 1) / 2) ** 2) [for odd n]

def rec_1(base,power)
  return 1 if power == 0

  base * rec_1(base, power-1)

end

puts rec_1(0,-2)

#3, 3

# (3,3)
